    Our Journey
   </h2>
   <div class="underline">
   </div>
   <div id="aa">
   <p>
    What started as a small initiative with a dream to make a difference has now grown into a full-fledged enterprise with a clear vision for a greener future. It all began when we attended a hackathon, where we saw the potential of working together to solve real-world problems. During this experience, we were inspired by other brands that are already doing great things in the sustainability space. Their efforts showed us that change is possible, but we also realized there was room to add a little extra touch.
    </p>
    <p>
While many brands focus on sustainability, we wanted to go beyond just making products. We wanted to bring something unique to the table—solutions that don’t just solve problems but also engage communities and inspire action. It was clear that we could create something truly special by not just focusing on the product itself but also on the impact we could have on people and the planet.
   </p>
   <p>
Pushp is all about giving that extra push-whether it’s through upcycling waste in innovative ways, supporting local communities, or finding new solutions to old problems. We don’t just want to be part of the movement; we want to lead it with our commitment to creating a sustainable future that’s more inclusive, impactful, and conscious.
